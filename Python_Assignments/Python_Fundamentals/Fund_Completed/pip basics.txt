    It thinks I should upgrade pip. 

So I upgraded it...

pip list

Logs: 
    $ pip list

    setuptools (16.0)
    Werkzeug (0.12.2)

Response/Knowledge: 
    I think this is a list of the current programs and their versions that pip natively supports. Research on the internet, confirms my thoughts. List installed packages, including editables. list with no parameters just returns everything.

 pip install Django
 ==================

Logs: 

    $ pip install Django
    Requirement already satisfied: Django in c:\python27\lib\site-packages
    Requirement already satisfied: pytz in c:\python27\lib\site-packages (from Django)

Knowledge: 
    This command uses pip to install Django. Basic install. I don't have questions about this. 

================
pip freeze 
=======================
Logs: 
    $ pip freeze
    click==6.7
    Django==1.11.2
    Flask==0.12.2
    itsdangerous==0.24
    Jinja2==2.9.6
    MarkupSafe==1.0
    pytz==2017.2
    Werkzeug==0.12.2

knowledge:
    pip list will "list installed packages including editables". 
    pip freeze will output installed packages in requirements format. 

    Requirements format, or requirements files, are files comtaining a list of tiems to be installed using pi install. Logically, a Requirements file is just a list of pip isntakll arguments placed in a file 
    Using pip freeze, I think you get the version of installed files that you would need for, maybe deploying apps? ... 


=========================
pip freeze > requirements.txt
=========================
This is just pip freeze outputing to file. Same thing the cmd prompt would do with that syntax. 

Contents of the output file: (exactly the same as running pip freeze)

    Django==1.11.2

    Werkzeug==0.12.2

===============================
pip uninstall Django
=======================
This just removed Django. 
It also removed all the python files used to run Django. 
It seems to me that Django is a toold built on Python, like Jquery is build on javascript. 



==============
pip show Django
=================
This is a way to see details about the application,. It does not say if it's installed ot not... 
    $ pip show Django
    Name: Django
    Version: 1.11.2
    Summary: A high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
    Home-page: https://www.djangoproject.com/
    Author: Django Software Foundation
    Author-email: foundation@djangoproject.com
    License: BSD
    Location: c:\python27\lib\site-packages
    Requires: pytz

This leads me to believe that python27 shipped with these libraries or ... whatever you call them, ready. 

=========================
pip search Flask
==================
I believe this is a list of all the flask "tools" that one can use with Python. There's a LOT. They do all kinds of things.
